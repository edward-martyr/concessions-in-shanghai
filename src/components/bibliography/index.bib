  abstract = {Between November 1938 and August 1939, approximately 20,000 Central European refugees, most of them Jews, landed in Shanghai. They had sailed on German, Italian, and Japanese ships and, in the short span of eight months, constituted a massive exodus. What, however, is the background to this phenomenon, and, moreover, why did it rapidly diminish after August 1939?1\&nbsp;In order to answer these questions, we must look at the larger setting within which this process took place \&mdash; something that, until now, has not been investigated},
