They had sailed on German, Italian, and Japanese ships and, in the short span of eight months, constituted a massive exodus. What, however, is the background to this phenomenon, and, moreover, why did it rapidly diminish after August 1939?1\&nbsp;In order to answer these questions, we must look at the larger setting within which this process took place \&mdash; something that, until now, has not been investigated},

  abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that the decade following the Washington Conference constituted a distinct epoch in the Far East. The revolutionary surge of Nationalist China with its warcry, “abolish the unequal treaties,” threw the foreign Powers on the defensive for the first time in a century. Skillful Chinese diplomacy supported by physical, moral, and economic force swept away foreign rights and privileges of long standing. Expansive world prosperity bolstered up a sagging Japanese financial structure and encouraged all the Powers to respect the self-denying pledges of the Washington treaties and the demands of Chinese nationalism. This period terminated with the Japanese attack on Mukden in September, 1931. As hard times put increasing strain upon the economy of the Island Empire, the Japanese army, with continental ambitions rekindled, launched a bold campaign for hegemony north of the Great Wall—and possibly south.             During the nineteen-twenties, the center of gravity in China shifted to the Yangtse Valley. Shanghai, the foreign-controlled metropolis which stands at the cross-roads of Far Eastern commerce and dominates an immense hinterland, assumed a position of increasing importance in the domestic economy and international politics of China.},

The paper mainly focuses on how the cadastre functioned as an instrument of power in different periods. It argues that the cadastre originated from and was influenced by the cadastre system in France, although it evolved with its own characteristics owing to the complex political and administrative configuration that prevailed in Shanghai. It actually took more than a half-century for the French municipality to make the cadastre the only effective means and instrument for the management of land and land tax. It took several successive land surveys to reveal all the land in the French Concession. Eventually, however, the Cadastral Office in the French Concession cadastre took precedence and dispossessed the Chinese authorities of their initial power over land.}

I want to show here what a great influence the decisions of the Soviet authorities had on the fate and survival of individual Jews - including active members of the Bund. The last part speaks about the Jewish socialists staying in Shanghai - a place that was culturally, linguistically and climatically different for the Eastern European Jews, comparing to their place of birth and past life, and it presents their political and social activities in the Shanghai ghetto.},
